# Handheld useless machine
A small machine witch whole purpose is to turn a switch to the other side every time it is flipped.
Is uses an arduino pro micro for controlling the server that moves the arm (an overkill). The cases that holds everything together can be 3d printed, it doesn't need any support but  the two pieces of the arm should be glued after printing.
